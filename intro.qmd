# Test chapter 

When accessing the (book) page, you will see a `WEBR STATUS` loading symbol at the top of the page. 
This loads some of the required (underlying packages for this page).
It may take a few seconds when you access this for the first time (and your browser has not yet cashed and downloaded the required package).

But it should be reasonable fast. 

Conceptually, once you see the *"green" Ready!* label. All prep work is done and the ensuing code windows work.

Give it a try ... and run the code!

```{webr-r}
# set a random seed and generate data
set.seed(123)
x <- rnorm(100)

# calculate mean
mean(x)
```
