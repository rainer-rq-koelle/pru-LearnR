The installation of the packages and their loading in webR may take a while.
The install is happening in the background, so do not worry.\
***WEBR STATUS Ready*** will be soon green!\
Once everything is set up, code execution will be quick.
Conceptually, you may also disconnect from the internet once the material is loaded.
