Don’t worry, once you’ve waited to load the package everything else will be quick.\n\n\n\n2.0.1 ggplot\n\nVery popular plotting package\nGood plots quickly\nDeclarative - describe what you want not how to build it\nContrasts w/Imperative - how to build it step by step\n\n\n\n2.0.2 Basics\n\nLoad the package and some data\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nTo build a plot using ggplot we start with the ggplot() function\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nggplot() creates a base ggplot object that we can then add things to - like a blank canvas\nWe can also add optional arguments for information to be shared across different components of the plot\nThe two main arguments we typically use here are\ndata - which is the name of the data frame we are working with, so acacia\nmapping - which describes which columns of the data are used for different aspects of the plot\nWe create a mapping by using the aes function, which stands for “aesthetic”, and then linking columns to pieces of the plot\nWe’ll start with telling ggplot what value should be on the x and y axes\nLet’s plot the relationship betwen the circumference of an acacia and its height\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nThis still doesn’t create a figure, it’s just a blank canvas and some information on default values for data and mapping columns to pieces of the plot\nWe can add data to the plot using layers\nWe do this by adding a + after the the ggplot function and then adding something called a geom, which stands for geometry\nTo make a scatter plot we use geom_point\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nTo change things about the layer we can pass additional arguments to the geom\nWe can do things like change\n\nthe size of the points, we’ll set it to 3\nthe color of the points, we’ll set it to \"blue\"\nthe transparency of the points, which is called alpha, we’ll set it to 0.5\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nTry changing these values to make the graph look like you want it to\nTo add labels (like documentation for your graphs!) we use the labs function\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n2.0.3 Grouping\n\nGroup on a single graph\nLook at influence of experimental treatment\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nTry changing the above code to color based on the gear\nWe can also split each group into different subplots (known as facets)\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nTry changing this code to create a subplot for each value in vs with points of size 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nMake a scatter plot with hp on the x axis and wt on the y axis. Label the x axis “Horse Power” and the y axis “Weight”. Make one subplot for each value in gear.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYour result should look like the plot below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected Result\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = wt)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Horse Power\", y = \"Weight\") +\n  facet_wrap(~gear)",
