# Preface {-}

This quarto-book was developed with the help of many colleagues.
It is also used to trial run the use of {webr} to allow for interactive content in online books.

This skeleton was setup for the {ggplot2} familiarisation and homework.
Just awesome!

While this might be disappointing for a first interaction.
This could be the basis for transferring all our sessions into this format and support future "pedestrians" to get achieve the "novice" level ... before embarking to become a "R/RStudio ecosystem ninja/jedi"!

May the forRce be with you!
