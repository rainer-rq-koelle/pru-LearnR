# Preface {.unnumbered}

This quarto-book was developed with the help of many colleagues.
It builds on the material presented and discussed during the *LearnR* sessions at EUROCONTROL.

This online book/resource is *work-in-progress* and represents a trial-run of the use of `{webr}` to allow for interactive content in online books.

This skeleton was setup for the recap on `{ggplot2}` and a follow-up session on recapping more `{dplyr}` and `{ggplot2}` stuff, and then venturing into `{gt}`.
It is planned to add the material from the first sessions as we go (and time permits).

While this might be disappointing for a first interaction.
This could be the basis for transferring all our sessions into this format and support future "pedestrians" to get achieve the "novice" level ...
before embarking to become a "R/RStudio ecosystem ninja/jedi"!

May the forRce be with you!
